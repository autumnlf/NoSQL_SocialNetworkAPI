## Description
```
For this homework assignment we are tasked with using MongoDB to build an API for a social network
platform. The application should allow creation/deletion/updating of users, creation/deletion/updating 
of user thoughts, and creation/deletion of reactions to thoughts. Users will also have a friends list
where friends can be added/removed.
```

### Acceptance Criteria:
```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
